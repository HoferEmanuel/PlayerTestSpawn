## Setup your Player-Spawn with a click.

Im currently working on a 3D-Plattformer.
Currently im doing alot of level-designing and i have to move the player from spot to spot
to check if the obstacle-couse is set up properly.
But after some time moving the player gets very tedious if doing it normaly.
